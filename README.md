## Proposals

1. **Human Origins Project Exploratory Data Analysis:** Using the data available in the [National Museum of Natural History collections search](https://collections.nmnh.si.edu/search/anth/) and the .json files associated with the 3D models located in the [3D Digitization Collections](https://3d.si.edu/collections/hominin-fossils), I would generate visuals exploring the relationships between the collections of early hominid fossils in the Human Origin Projects collection. Ideas for visualization include geographic locations, body parts, relationships between the various species, estimated periods of life and discovery, etc. Since the json files also include 3D models of the fossils, I was thinking that there could be further analysis of the 3D models using Three.js’s json viewer or the python-based 3D modeling program Blender.

    This project may be a challenge given the amount of web-scraping needed to generate the dataset, but I do have familiarity with NMNH’s website and the json files on [3d.si.edu](https://3d.si.edu/).

 2. **OEWS Research Estimates by State and Industry:** using [this dataset](https://www.bls.gov/oes/2020/may/oes_research_estimates.htm) of wage and employment estimates by state and industry for all sectors collected for one year (2020), I would focus on occupation types and industry per state. Possible correlations I could make would be dominant industries per state and income inequality for the same occupations between states. A specific hypothesis could concern how the size of a given industry in a given state effects the income level in comparison to the same occupation in a different state where the industry is less dominant (Null hypothesis: occupations that are part of a dominant industry of a state do not have a higher income level than the equivalent occupation in a state where that sector is not dominant).

3. **Mushroom Classification:** [This dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification) from Kaggle contains qualitative information on different types of mushrooms in North America. I believe this dataset could provide for interesting exploratory visualizations. Hypotheses could also be drawn between physical similarities of mushrooms and their geographic location and how dangerous they are, i.e. whether or not it is common for two physically similar mushroom species in the same area to have opposite levels of editability. The dataset’s description on Kaggle states:

    >“The Guide clearly states that there is no simple rule for determining the edibility of a mushroom; no rule like "leaflets three, let it be'' for Poisonous Oak and Ivy.”

    It might be worthwhile to see if the dataset supports this claim or not.

4. **Video Game Data:** Exploring one specific year in [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/juttugarakesh/video-game-data), it would be possible to generate comparisons of popularity between genres, companies and systems across regions. Picking an intentional date, like the start of a new console generation might yield interesting information and allow for a basis of hypothesis testing given popularity and accessability of given category per geographic region.
